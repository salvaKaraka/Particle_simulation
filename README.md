# Particle simulation:
Computer graphics is a fascinating fild of computer science. Who would have thought that with a couple of functions and basic physics, we could create fairly accurate simulations of real-world natural systems? I'm by no means an expert in this field, but I would like to become one in the future. This is my first attempt at graphics programming. I hope you find this project useful or interesting, at least. Enjoy!
